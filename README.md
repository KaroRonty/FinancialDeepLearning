LSTM and GRU deep learning models applied to analyze the effect of scraped past 30-day Coindesk news sentiment on future 10-day volatility for five different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ether, and XRP. These models are used together with accumulated local effects to visualize the effects of the sentiment.

The research paper is available [here](https://github.com/KaroRonty/FinancialDeepLearning/blob/main/Paper.pdf). The code in this repo is mostly based on Jupyter Notebooks and might be incomplete.
